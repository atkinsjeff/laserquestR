59C - has a lot of water in it and the top is hilly. There is a lag in the first phase but it is mostly open anyway.

58W - Need to delete between 3 and fourth marker. and restart
the transect at the 4th marker so that the series is complete.
I slipped

Also for 58, the west transect is steep but the others are not. however the plot is fairly species homo.

61 - The middle plot is really steep.

Also, the center was done northwards for safety
 
55 - The plot south part is in a gully so i adjusted to start at the center and go 20 m north out of necessity

46E patch together two

60E ran going south
60C ran going north

51C - add 20 m marker in there
