58E only 30 m
65C AUGUST
55W second marker estimated and inserted in post-
60C  50 m
61C 50 m
50E only 30 m
50W run twice

Have some other data from plot 58 that need cleaning and have no markers

GSRM 55C - there were only three segments flagged so I walked an approx. additional 10 m past last flag, so 10 m outside what would be the transect.

GSRM 55W need to add a second marker halfway between 1st and 3rd. Also had to walk additional 10 m. 

GRSM ("GRSW") 50W second take and C, E ran run in reverse. E cut at 30

GRSM 61 C - ignore/delete typo last point @ end of transect

GRSM66E- ran backwards

GRSM65W- large gap at end of transect


65 - reddid center for a thir dplot. first marker didnt ttake
58w - both run and markers not working. should be good though
58C -move fourth marker about 1000 places further down
