35 -1 all good
done 35 -2 I double tapped some. Need to remove markers. Take the first of each doubletap

Plot 35 go t fucked up and only 4 transects ran

Plot sequence goes 35_1 for most south to 35_5 most north. GPS in the SE corn plots are 40 x 100 m
with 40 m east to west

done 01 - 04 There is a double tap marker right before the actual fourth marker. There is a problem area in the data there likelydue to fallen log.
Maybe lose a couple of seconds of data tthere.

done deleted first marker so the code kills all before it. 01-03 is 50 m too long. First segment is the one to lose

The light msmts are off. 

01-1 is also 02-6 because they share a border

done added marker at 7347 02-3 has an extra fourth marker and is mising a third

done 04_4 needsfirstmarker and there is an accidental marker in after the second marker

done 06_5 has an extra marker. ther ewere also a bees in segment 4-5 and i moved real fast.

done 06_6 has an additional segment to fold in as it was short one.

left it 05-1 has one too many
